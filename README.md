## What is this scenario?
This is a mission where the players play as an Ork klan, the Evil Sunz, their mission is to fight their way through 3 maze tunnel systems, that get easier to navigate as you go on but harder to to push through.
The scenario was designed with a lot of death in mind and that the players would act as Orks rather than tactically, my guys enjoyed it so I thought of publishing it so others can have fun.

A Zeus is recommended but not required.


## Zeus Guide
There are very few things to keep in mind as a Zeus as a Zeus is not even required for the mission to function however it is recommended:
- Remote control statics to ensure player suppression if AI is being too dumb.
- You have a space marine skeleton, feel free to melee the players every now and then.
- Placing respawn points your self at each phase as the players advance is a good thing to do if you don't want your players to spend time walking into a fight, specially in phase 1.
- The mission has a friendly fire script running that will log any friendly fire incident into the RPT and notify the Zeus/logged in admin of who did it to who.
